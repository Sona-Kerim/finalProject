         <p className='tarot-information'>Tarot cards are a divination tool with 78 cards divided into Major and Minor Arcanas. Each card has its own symbolism and meaning, used for spiritual guidance and insight in Tarot readings. The Major Arcana represents life lessons and growth, while the Minor Arcana represents day-to-day experiences. Tarot readings provide clarity and inspiration, but it's the reader's interpretation and intuition that hold the true power.</p></div>
